          <p style="text-align: justify;">Throwback to the last semester when I got to volunteer at the job fair! It was a great experience where I got to enhance my management skills. I had to make sure everything went smoothly, and I learned how to juggle lots of things at once, solve problems, and use my time wisely.

            But the best part was chatting with all the professionals and folks who came by. I made some awesome connections, picked up useful tips, and it's been super helpful for my career journey. It was a real eye-opener, and I'm excited for more chances like this in the future! </p>
